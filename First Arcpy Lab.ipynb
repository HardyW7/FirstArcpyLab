    "This project was a difficult one to figure out where to start. In the end I tried to think of every step and its goal in terms of the GUI. I kept asking myself what buttons/tools would I use if Python was not involved.  This probably means that my solution is not the most elegant or efficient but it seems to have gotten the job done. Over the course of 3 days I spent probably about 8 hours actually in front of a computer but quite a few more considering a plan of action."

    "This block has two pieces. The second piece was the result of a few different trials. I tried using the 'SelectByAttribute' tool (which needed 'MakeFeastureLayer' and 'CopyFeatures' to make a new shapefile) but after hunting through google found that 'Select_analysis' was supposudely faster. The reason I was concerned about speed: I was trying to use the search cursor to output shapefiles.  I was able to make a new shapefile but the process was done 4000+ times because the code was looping over every record.  To avoid this (hopefully my problem makes sense) I created a list of county names and parsed through that list in the second block rather than through each record.  The ogr2ogr tool was suprisingly easy to implement. I figured that deleting the unwanted shapefiles was good housekeeping."
